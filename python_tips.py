To modify list elements in place: use list comprehensions:
eg. image_index[0:] = [image[0].split() for image in image_index[0:]]

Pandas data frame: each row has an index, access row need iloc[] func if we pass an integer, or use loc[''] is we pass a label. 

Determine whether an element is in list:

3 in [1, 2, 3] :: return true
